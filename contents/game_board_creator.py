Game Board Creator Module for Avirta

This module handles the creation and management of game boards for Avirta games.
It provides functions for creating game boards, selecting questions, and managing
answered questions.

This implementation follows PRJ-012 from the Avirta Rule Book, which requires
centralized game board creation with support for configurable number of questions
per category and multiple questions with the same point value.
