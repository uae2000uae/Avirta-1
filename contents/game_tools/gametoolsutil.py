Game Tools Utility Module for Avirta

This module provides utility functions for handling game tools in the web application,
bridging between the HTTP layer and the core game tools functionality.

It includes functions for:
- Processing tool usage requests
- Handling tool-specific HTTP responses
- Managing session state for tools
