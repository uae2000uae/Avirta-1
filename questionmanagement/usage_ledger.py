"""Per-instance usage ledger (grow-only counters) for question `use_count`.

Why this exists
---------------
`use_count` is a counter incremented from many game sessions/instances. Storing
it inline in the question files makes it *unmergeable* — two sessions both read
5, both write 6, and the true 7 is lost — and it rewrites the whole category
file on every single play (constant churn).

This module keeps each running instance's usage in its OWN file:

    datastore/usage/usage_<INSTANCE_ID>.json   ->   { "Q0001331": 12, ... }

Each instance only ever writes its own file, so pushes never conflict and no
increment is ever lost (a grow-only / G-Counter CRDT). The effective use count
of a question is:

    effective = base (value frozen in the question file) + sum of that id
                across all ledger files

The question files themselves are NEVER rewritten on a play, so they stop
churning and only change on genuine content edits (admin add/edit/delete).

Public surface
--------------
    increment(question_id)          -> bump this instance's tally by 1
    get_totals()                    -> {question_id: total across all ledgers}
    this_ledger_relpath()           -> repo-relative path of this instance's file
    rollup_into_question_files(...)  -> (optional, single-writer) fold totals into
                                        the question files and compact ledgers
